Usage of multilayer perceptron to diagnose diseases

Program devoloped using Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) to find an accurate diagnosis of respiratory diseases from the symptoms 
presented by the patient.
In order to find the disease which best matches the symptoms, the program asks the user twenty-one questions, the inputs of the
system; 
Therefore, the user would only answer 1 for "yes" and 0 for "no", if he or she was not with the symptom. 
At the end of this, the system returns to the user the respiratory disease corresponding to the symptoms presented, among the 
eleven respiratory diseases registered in our database.
